# boolean_logic_gates
This will give the outputs of each boolean operator/logic gate from user input and will be extended into being completely interactive with drag-and-drop logic gates.

For now, you must run it with python3 in the terminal:
> *$python3 circuits.py*

V1: Can request user input for boolean operators and will just perform a quick check on every operator (except NOT)

However, it'll be completely interactive soon with drag-and-drop logic gates--possibly by the end of the next two weeks.


## TO-DO:
* add NOT operator (unary)
* generalize operator classes
  * use inheritance for binary and unary operators
* extend so user can add multiple boolean pairs > 2
* add connection of operators
  * through user input
* add connection jumps
  * most likely only have to be visual
* implement javascript for visual logic gates & puzzle drawing
* add database for storing previous logic puzzles
  * public accessible
  * user accessible
