# boolean_logic_gates
This will give the outputs of each boolean operator/logic gate from user input and will be extended into being completely interactive with drag-and-drop logic gates.

For now, you must run it with python3 in the terminal:
$python3 circuits.py

V1: Can request user input for boolean operators and will just perform a quick check on every operator (except NOT)

However, it'll be completely interactive soon with drag-and-drop logic gates--possibly by the end of the next two weeks.
